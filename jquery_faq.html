<h1>National Park FAQ</h1>

<dl>
    <dt>What was the second national park created?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The second national park created (Yellowstone was the first) is a
        national park no longer. Mackinac National Park was established in 1875, but
        returned to the state of Michigan just 20 years later in 1895. It’s now designated as
        a state park.</dd>
    <dt>What is the largest national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Our nation’s largest national park is Wrangell-St. Elias National
        Park in Alaska. The park covers 13,000 square miles. On the opposite side of the
        spectrum, Arkansas’ Hot Springs National Park is the smallest at 5,500 acres. It’s
        was also the first federally protected piece of land in 1832 yet wasn’t named a
        national park until 1921.</dd>
    <dt>Which park hosts the most visitors each year?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">While you might think Yellowstone tops the list, Great Smoky
        Mountains National Park hosts the most visitors each year. More than 9 million guests
        visit the park annually.</dd>
    <dt>What’s the difference between a national park and national monument?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"> Often confused, national parks are selected for their natural
        beauty, unique geology and unusual ecosystems. National monuments, on the other hand,
        are chosen for historical or archeological significance.</dd>
    <dt>Which presidents have the most parks named after them?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt have the most sites
        in the system named for them at four apiece.</dd>
    <dt>Are there any states that have no national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Only one state is home to neither a national park or a national
        monument. Believe it or not, it’s actually the country’s first state – Delaware.</dd>
    <dt>Are any national parks south of the equator?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">There is actually an NPS site south of the equator: the National
        Park of Samoa. This national park covers 13,500 total acres and nearly 4,000 acres
        protect coral reefs.</dd>
    <dt>What is the largest national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The lower 48 states’ largest park, Death Valley National Park, also
        boasts being home to the lowest point in the western hemisphere; Badwater Basin is
        282 feet below sea level.</dd>
    <dt>What is the national park emblem?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">That NPS emblem includes: a sequoia tree and bison to represent
        vegetation and wildlife, mountains and water to represent recreational values, and an
        arrowhead to represent historical and archaeological values.</dd>
    <dt>How many people do national parks employ?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The National Park Service employs 20,000 people annually. In
        addition, these employees are assisted by 246,00 Volunteers-In-Parks (VIPs) who donate
        about 6.7 million hours each year.</dd>
